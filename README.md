# Graph Library

Graph Library is a C++ library for working with graphs.
A lot of the times we have to work with graphs and need to code every algorithm every single time be it working on a project or competitive coding.
We dont need to reinvent the wheel.
Use this library instead.

## Installation

To use this library in your project, simply include the `graphkit.h` header file in your source code.

```cpp
#include "graphkit.h"
